# Python tasks
# 1
Write a program that prints part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... (a number is repeated as many times as it is equal to). A non-negative integer n is passed to the input of the program — this is how many elements of the sequence the program should display. The output is expected to be a sequence of numbers separated by a space in one line.
For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.
# 2
Output a table of size n×n, filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in a spiral emerging from the upper left corner and twisted clockwise
# 3
Write a program that takes a list of numbers as input in one line. The program must for each element of this list print the sum of its two neighbors. For list elements that are extreme, one of the neighbors is the element located at the opposite end of this list. For example, if the input is the list "1 3 5 6 10", then the output is expected to be the list "13 6 9 15 7" (without quotes).

If only one number came to the input, you need to output it.

The output should contain one line with the numbers of the new list separated by a space.
