# Python---tasks
# 1
Write a program that prints part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... (a number is repeated as many times as it is equal to). A non-negative integer n is passed to the input of the program — this is how many elements of the sequence the program should display. The output is expected to be a sequence of numbers separated by a space in one line.
For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.
# 2
Output a table of size n×n, filled with numbers from 1 to n^2 in a spiral emerging from the upper left corner and twisted clockwise
