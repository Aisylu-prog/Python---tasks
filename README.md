Write a program that prints part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 ... (a number is repeated as many times as it is equal to). A non-negative integer n is passed to the input of the program â€” this is how many elements of the sequence the program should display. The output is expected to be a sequence of numbers separated by a space in one line.
For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4.
